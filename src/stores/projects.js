    The rules were simple, attempt so make some kind of convincing logo or dev signature using only my initials and some extra lines (but keeping it simple). Due to my software engineering background, the logo needed to be made with real keyboard characters.
    After some playing around with letters, I put them together a bit better in paint, and what looked like the first toad face appeared. This was not intentional, but after making it I kinda thought it looked like a frog.
    I will attempt to improve it in the future and try to make it look less wonky. This above logo came from another idea, making a frog out of special characters and punctuations.
    Although my real name has nothing to do with toads, they have become my official mascot. The toad is also big in japanese culture, which is cool`;
